> What is currying and is it really **hot**?

From Wikipedia:

*Curry (/ˈkʌri/, plural curries) is a dish originating in the cuisine of the Indian Subcontinent. The common feature is the use of complex combinations of spices or herbs, usually including fresh or dried hot chillies.*

There are very few things I like more than spices, herbs and fresh chillies, but that is not the reason I am writing this post. Lately, what has me really fired up is [functional programming]({% post_url 2016-04-16-intro-to-functional-programming %}) - to that extent that I'm sometimes forgetting my lunch because of it!

One thing that has been bouncing around in my head lately is the simple fact that:

**The same way a function can return any value such as [42][42]{:target="_blank"}, it can also return another function as the result.**

> Awesome! Wait, how is this useful?

In functional programming it is all about composing simple functions together to do one complex task. This keeps our code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself){:target="_blank"} and easy to maintain.

What if we have a complex function that does some heavy processing? Such complicated functions by nature tend to accept multiple parameters, and the interesting thing is that:

**Often we can often divide the parameter list of such functions into 2 groups:**

1. *Configuration parameters*, for example:
  - Direction of sorting for a sort function
  - Dictionary for a spell checker
2. *Actual data* to be processed
  - Array to be sorted
  - Words to be spell checked

Why not take advantage of this fact and try to **decompose** our function into **2 simpler functions**, to make our life a little bit easier?

## Partial Function Application

Even though this sounds complicated, you can think of it as:

**If we have a function that takes three arguments, we can call it with only one or two arguments, and still get a result back.**

> Ok, but what does it return?

It will return yet **another function**! We can then call this function with the rest of arguments to finish the job, and get the actual result back.

We can use this to first pass our *configuration parameters* and get a function back to which we can later pass the *data parameters*, to get the result.

Let's look at a really simple example to illustrate this point in code:

{% capture ruby %}
def greeting(hi, remark)
  lambda { |person| "#{hi}, #{person}! #{remark}" }
end

ahoy = greeting("Ahoy", "Weigh anchor...")
hi   = greeting("Hi", "Let's go...")

ahoy.call("Joe") # Ahoy, Joe! Weigh anchor...
hi.call("Joe")   # Hi, Joe! Let's go...
{% endcapture %}
{% capture elixir %}
def greeting(hi, remark) do
  fn (person) -> "#{hi}, #{person}! #{remark}" end
end

ahoy = greeting("Ahoy", "Weigh anchor...")
hi   = greeting("Hi", "Let's go...")

ahoy.("Joe")  # Ahoy, Joe! Weigh anchor...
hi.("Joe")    # Hi, Joe! Let's go...
{% endcapture %}
{% capture javascript %}
function greeting(hi, remark) {
  return function(person) {
    return hi + ', ' + person + '! ' + remark;
  };
}

var ahoy = greeting("Ahoy", "Weigh anchor...");
var hi   = greeting("Hi", "Let's go...");

ahoy("Joe"); // Ahoy, Joe! Weigh anchor...
hi("Joe");   // Hi, Joe! Let's go...

// In JavaScript we can also achieve the same result with:
function greeting(hi, remark, person) {
  return hi + ', ' + person + '! ' + remark;
};

var ahoy = greeting.bind(null, "Ahoy", "Weigh anchor...");
ahoy("Joe"); // Ahoy, Joe! Weigh anchor...
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html %}

As you can see, we first pass in the `hi` and the `remark` parameters to **configure our greeting**. And then we get the customized greeting function which takes only the `person` argument.

This is useful, because now we only need to **pass the *configuration parameters* once**, and then we can **use the function many times on different data.**

## Making It Even More Modular - Currying

We all know that we must DRY our spices well, before we use them. It just happens to also be true for programming and functions.

To achieve maximum flavor, we can create a **chain** of functions where each takes **only one parameter**. Something like this:

{% capture ruby %}
def greeting(hi)
  lambda { |remark|
    lambda { |person| "#{hi}, #{person}! #{remark}" }
  }
end

hi = greeting("Hi")
hi_lets_go = hi.call("Let's go...")
hi_you_look_nice = hi.call("You look nice...")

hi_lets_go("Joe")       # Hi, Joe! Let's go...
hi_you_look_nice("Joe") # Hi, Joe! You look nice!
{% endcapture %}
{% capture elixir %}
def greeting(hi) do
  fn (remark) ->
    fn (person) -> "#{hi}, #{person}! #{remark}" end
  end
end

hi = greeting("Hi")
hi_lets_go = hi.("Let's go...")
hi_you_look_nice = hi.("You look nice...")

hi_lets_go("Joe")       # Hi, Joe! Let's go...
hi_you_look_nice("Joe") # Hi, Joe! You look nice!
{% endcapture %}
{% capture javascript %}
function greeting(hi) {
  return function(remark) {
    return function(person) {
      return hi + ', ' + person + '! ' + remark;
    };
  };
}

var hi = greeting("Hi");
var hi_lets_go = hi("Let's go...");
var hi_you_look_nice = hi("You look nice...");

hi_lets_go("Joe");       # Hi, Joe! Let's go...
hi_you_look_nice("Joe"); # Hi, Joe! You look nice!
{% endcapture %}
{% include code.html %}

This technique is called **function currying**, after [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Curry){:target="_blank"}.

> Why is it better than the previous example?

Great question! The first example with *partial application* has one big problem - **it forces us to provide both the first and the second argument at the same time**.

Sometimes we may want to apply the second and the third parameter together, or maybe each one individually. **Function currying** gives us the freedom to do so while having only one implementation of the function.

This has proven to be so useful that many languages, like [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org){:target="_blank"} by default curry all the functions you define.

## Partial Application vs. Currying

Here is a rule of thumb to quickly differentiate the two:

- Partial application predetermines which parameters must be passed together, currying does not.
- Currying always produces a chain of functions where each one takes only one argument, while partial application can produce functions which take any number of arguments.
